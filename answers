1. The push, which adds an element to the array, and pop, which removes the last element in the array.
(last in, first out)

2. The enqueue that adds an element the the end of the array, and dequeue that removes the first element

// First we divide the unsorted list in two half, seconde we divide each half also in half until
we get many arrays whit one element inside, third we merge the elements inside the arrays in to a new array, but this time sorted, fourth 
we compare the first element of the array with the first element of the next array and pass the smalest element in to a new array, then 
proside whit the secon element of the array, and we kip doing this until all the arrays merge in to one sorted array.
